# transcription_aws

this is a summary of the use of aws-transcribe
We tested 11 speakers with a variety in their speech features.
The speakers read a text that resembles a scrum meeting. We took 
the recordings and "clean" them with pyAudioAnalysis (See https://github.com/cbanuelosintek/audiopreprocess).
